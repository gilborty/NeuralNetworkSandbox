#Neural Network Sandbox

A simple C++ coding sandbox to learn about neural networks from actually programming.

I am currently following this [awesome tutorial](https://vimeo.com/19569529) from David Miller on how to program a simple nerual network in C++.

To build this example, follow the typical CMake build process of:
* `mkdir build`
* `cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`
